<p align="center">everyone's favorite little schizo creature. handler of tbh pliskin. <br>
if im online i'm somewhere near my pc but might not be looking at the screen. just gimmie a bit LOL <br>
im antisocial but i've been told i'm easy to get along with. take that as you will<br>
i very much enjoy running up to ponies from any of my special interests (valve games, metal gear,dmc and yakuza)</br>
i also like to always sit near green names. if i sit next to you and say absolutely nothing thats why<br>
i space out pretty often. i try to keep track but if it's urgent whisper me i'll see it eventually<br>
i don't use tone tags unless it's something i personally feel like could be misinterpreted, don't be scared to ask me to clarify<br>
that's about it. just dont be a weirdo and we can get along.
